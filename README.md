# ARIN ROA Request and List/Deletion Scripts
Two scripts to connect to ARIN's OT&E and Production RESTful APIs.  One script is to create ROAs and the other is to list/delete them.

**Note! The scripts arin-roa-request.py and arin-delete-roas.py by default only make an API call to ARIN's OT&E (Operational Test & Evaluation) Environment.  Any change made in the OT&E is just a test and does not impact the "real" environment.  If you want to make an API call to ARIN's production API, specify the -p/--production command line argument.**

The scripts need the BeautifulSoup4, lxml (used by BeautifulSoup4 for xml decoding), and requests python modules.  They can be installed by executing:
`pip3 install beautifulsoup4 lxml requests`

In order to execute the scripts you will need to generate an API key.  See this link to find out more info on generating an API key with ARIN: https://www.arin.net/reference/materials/security/api_keys/

To create ROAs you will also need a private key that will be used to sign your ROAs.  The OT&E has a special private key that is used for signing all ROAs in that test environment.  The test private key can be downloaded here: https://www.arin.net/reference/tools/testing/ote_roa_req_signing_key.private.pem 
More info is here: https://www.arin.net/reference/tools/testing/#roa-request-generation-key-pairs

For production, you will need to generate your own public/private key pair to create ROAs.  This procedure is documented at https://www.arin.net/resources/manage/rpki/roa_request/

Hereâ€™s the procedure to generate a public/private keypair:

This command generates a ROA Request Generation Key Pair and saves it as a file named org_privkey.pem:

`openssl genrsa -out org_privkey.pem 2048`

This command extracts the public key from the org_privkey.pem and writes it to a file named `org_pubkey.pem`:

`openssl rsa -in org_privkey.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out org_pubkey.pem`

For ARIN, the contents of the `org_pubkey.pem` needs to be uploaded to "Public Key" section of the Managing RPKI page of the ORG-ID.  See https://www.arin.net/resources/manage/rpki/hosted/#cert-request

Keep the `org_privkey.pem` file private, perhaps in an HSM.  If the security of the private key is compromised, you should delete all of the ROAs created with that key and generate a new key pair and new ROAs.

The ROA creation script needs to have a CSV file specified which defines the values for each ROA that is created.  The format of the CSV is:
Origin AS,IP prefix,CIDR mask,maxLength
Ex: `65000,192.0.2.0,24,24`

**Note, the maxLength is required in this script!  It is recommended that the maxLength be equal to the CIDR mask.  If you set the maxLength too large (ex. /24 or /48) you open yourself up to a potential forged-origin subprefix hijack (see this IETF doc: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-rpkimaxlen)**

The ROA creation script can be run like this for OT&E:
`./arin-roa-request.py -c ROAs.txt -a <ARIN API KEY> -k ote_roa_req_signing_key.private.pem -o <ORG-ID> --debug`

The ROA creation script can be run like this for production (note -p command line argument specified for production):
`./arin-roa-request.py -c ROAs.txt -a <ARIN API KEY> -k orgkeypair.pem -o <ORG-ID> -p`

The ROA deletion script can be run like this to output a CSV list of existing ROAs in OT&E and put the CSV into a file:
`./arin-delete-roas.py -l  -a <ARIN API KEY> -o <ORG-ID> > ROAs-to-be-deleted.csv`

You can now edit the ```ROAs-to-be-deleted.csv``` file and remove the ROAs that you don't want to be deleted.

The ROA deletion script can be run like this to delete a CSV list of existing ROAs (use output from list command above) in OT&E:
`./delete-roas.py -f <CSV file of ROAs to delete> -o <ORG-ID> -a <ARIN API KEY>`

Again, if you want to execute the two above commands on the production API, use the `-p` switch.


**And remember, when you create ROAs for your prefixes you are protecting those prefixes against BGP origin hijacks.  When you perform ROV (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6811) on your eBGP routers, you are helping to protect others from BGP origin hijacks.  It only takes one ASN in the AS path to perform ROV for protection against BGP origin hijacks. The more networks that implement these technologies, the safer we all are!**
